People who are depressed may resort to using substances such as drugs or alcohol as a coping mechanism, which can provide temporary relief but ultimately exacerbate the condition long-term. On the other hand, prolonged use of mind-altering substances can lead to changes in brain chemistry that increase an individual's vulnerability to developing depression. Substance abuse and addiction often co-occur with mental health issues like depression; therefore, it is critical for those facing both conditions to seek specialized integrated treatment approaches addressing both aspects simultaneously."],
